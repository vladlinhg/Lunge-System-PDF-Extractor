Objective:  The main objective of this study was to examine the use of wearable health care devices and the key predictors of wearable use by US adults. Methods:  Using a national survey of 4551 respondents, we examined the usage patterns of wearable health care devices (use of wearables, frequency of their use, and willingness to share health data from a wearable with a provider) and a set of predictors that pertain to personal demographics (age, gender, race, education, marital status, and household income), individual health (general health, presence of chronic conditions, weight perceptions, frequency of provider visits, and attitude towards exercise), and technology self-efficacy using logistic regression analysis. Results:  About 30% (1266/4551) of US adults use wearable health care devices. Among the users, nearly half (47.33%) use the devices every day, with a majority (82.38% weighted) willing to share the health data from wearables with their care providers. Women (16.25%), White individuals (19.74%), adults aged 18-50 years (19.52%), those with some level of college education or college graduates (25.60%), and those with annual household incomes greater than US $75,000 (17.66%) were most likely to report using wearable health care devices. We found that the use of wearables declines with age: Adults aged >50 years were less likely to use wearables compared to those aged 18-34 years (odds ratios [OR] 0.46-0.57). Women (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.96-1.65), White individuals (OR 1.65, 95% CI 0.97-2.79), college graduates (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.31-3.51), and those with annual household incomes greater than US $75,000 (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.39-4.86) were more likely to use wearables. US adults who reported feeling healthier (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.98-1.39), were overweight (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.06-1.27), enjoyed exercise (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.06-1.43), and reported higher levels of technology self-efficacy (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.21-1.46) were more likely to adopt and use wearables for tracking or monitoring their health. Conclusions:  The potential of wearable health care devices is under-realized, with less than one-third of US adults actively using these devices. With only younger, healthier, wealthier, more educated, technoliterate adults using wearables, other groups have been left behind. More concentrated efforts by clinicians, device makers, and health care policy makers are needed to bridge this divide and improve the use of wearable devices among larger sections of American society.

Introduction Concerns have also been raised about the accuracy of data gathered by wearables in people of color [18]. Technology Background and Motivation acceptance of new wearable devices remains another significant Advances in wireless sensors and digital technologies have led barrier [19]. Despite the forecasted growth, use of these devices to a proliferation of wearable health care devices with which has reportedly slowed [20]. Market studies have pointed out a users can examine, monitor, and track their physiological gradual  decline  in  the  use  of  these  devices  as  well  as conditions.  Wearable  health  care  devices  are  autonomous, abandonment within a few months of purchase [21,22]. noninvasive, wearable equipment with embedded sensors to collect a variety of physiological health information [1]. These Extant research on the use of wearables has found these devices devices range from the popular fitness trackers (eg, Fitbit, to increase physical activity, increase energy expenditure, and AppleWatch, Samsung, Galaxy Fit) that collect data on physical reduce sedentary behavior [23]. Wearables offer an easy way activities such as number of steps taken, calories burned, sleep to obtain large amounts of real-time health data that can be duration, and heart rate to more sophisticated devices that can useful for clinicians [24]. Health data obtained from wearables, collect information on blood pressure, glucose levels, and when combined with sophisticated machine learning algorithms, oxygen levels. The collected health data can be transmitted to have helped develop predictive models that can greatly improve smartphones or other computer-aided applications to store and health delivery [25-27]. If effectively used, wearables can analyze to provide appropriate health interventions. Fueled by greatly help in the management of several conditions including increased popularity, the use of wearables has significantly rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases [28,29], chronic pain increased in recent years. According to estimates, the market management  [30],  and  cardiovascular  problems  [31].

Most extant studies have largely examined the intention to adopt wearable devices [32-36] rather Wearable health care devices offer several potential benefits to than the actual usage. Further, these studies have focused on a users. First, they offer a convenient way to monitor, store, and limited set of antecedents driven by the technology adoption share health information in real-time. Second, wearables provide lens. Hence, we know very little about US adults' use of feedback to users to make appropriate changes to their daily wearables and key influential factors affecting usage. Addressing routines or behavior [3,4]. Third, wearables can facilitate remote this gap, we build on an emergent stream of studies to examine patient monitoring and provide proactive and faster data access the key factors affecting the use of wearable health care devices to physicians, resulting in improved health outcomes [4,5] and by US adults. reduced number of physician visits [6].

Although our findings educated, and technoliterate adults are more likely to use are consistent with other studies that have found fewer adopters wearables.

Future work should attempt to explore more The potential of wearable health care devices is under-realized, predictors of the frequency of wearable usage and the actual with less than one-third of US adults actively using these sharing of wearable data with providers. Our study has many devices. With only younger, healthier, wealthier, more educated, limitations.
