Riding the wave of hope and potential, patients are actively seeking stem cell therapy for a number of  musculoskeletal conditions, such as degenerative conditions, in particular osteoarthritis (OA). Yet, the  scientific evidence for effectiveness is inconclusive and recommendations for clinical application are  variable. Further, there is increasing concern/focus on issues related to stem cell safety in this largely  unregulated environment. To address these challenges we currently face regarding stem cell therapy for  osteoarthritis,  the  purpose  of  the  AHS  BJH  SCN  Stem  Cell  Workshop  is  to  engage  a  range  of  stakeholders in an evidence-based discussion to contribute to the realization of the potential of stem cells  by  generating  recommendations  to  inform  practice,  research  and/or  policy  regarding  this  emerging  therapeutic approach. This white paper aims to provide the background and an overview of the current  knowledge on stem cells, specifically mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), in the treatment of OA to enable  an evidence-based foundation for the workshop and the discussion that we will engage in to understand  the  topic  of  stem  cells  and  generate  ideas  that  will  inform  the  path  forward  in  Alberta.  We conducted  a  systematic  search  of  the  published  literature  to  generate  a  knowledge  synthesis  regarding the efficacy and safety of MSC-based treatments for OA. This knowledge synthesis was  focused on reviews published between 2010 and 2016 (up to May), which included human clinical trials  focused on cartilage repair and symptom relief. The results of this work indicate that MSCs are sourced  from a number of different areas within the body; in the treatment of OA, with the most common sources  being bone marrow and adipose tissue. There are also a number of different approaches currently used  to prepare MSC for delivery via injection and implantation -  a surgical procedure that often also includes  the use of matrices and/or scaffolds. In conjunction with MSC treatment, co-interventions are often used,  such as microfracture sub-chondral drilling, debridement, and platelet rich plasma. Due to the significant  variability associated with the MSC sources, current techniques and approaches being applied in the  preparation  and  delivery  of  MSC  therapies,  and  the  number  of  different  co-interventions  used  in  conjunction with MSCs, it is challenging to make conclusive statements regarding the efficacy of MSCs.  Broadly, based on the results clinical trials and expert opinion, MSC as a therapy for OA are considered  safe, although there are areas of concern that require investigation, and there are indicators that they are  efficacious  (symptom  relief  and  structural  repair).  However,  although  promising,  these  results  are  preliminary and not definitive. Advancing knowledge on MSC therapy requires that a number of issues  are addressed. These include, but are not limited to, standardization of protocols, enhancing the rigor of  study designs (which includes long term outcomes tracking), and determining patient characteristics that  influence effectiveness. The realization of the potential of stem cells as a viable therapeutic option is also  based on a determination of who is responsible for safety (e.g. Government, regulatory bodies) and  effectiveness  (e.g.  researchers,  clinicians,  policy  makers). Therefore,  progress  forward  is  a  shared  responsibility, central to which are the patients seeking and undertaking this form of treatment for their  OA.

According to mainstream media, such as the recent cover of  Time magazine \u2013 \u201cbig things are on the horizon thanks to stem cells and it is not too far away!\u201d That is the  hope, however, it is not yet clear that our understanding of what we are calling stem cells, specifically  mesenchymal stem cells , or more accurately, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), has kept pace with the  potential applications being lauded. Unfortunately, the popular press has created a hype that has  overtaken the hope in some circumstances, and created unreasonable expectations regarding the  successful application of this emerging therapeutic approach given our current scientific knowledge in this  area. Although demand is increasing, there is ample data from animal studies but limited clinical data,  and limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms of action, upon which to base clinical application  in patient populations.  The hope of stem cells also appears to mean different things to different stakeholder groups. Many  researchers feel we need to have a comprehensive understanding about the cells before we should  attempt applications. Patients with painful, debilitating diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA) want effective  treatment  solutions.  Clinicians  see  the  needs  of  the  patients  and  want  to  implement  effective  interventions, informed by clinical experience and what information is currently available. And finally,  Governments have a vested interest in supporting both research and the implementation of clinically  effective and cost effective procedures. Thus, a key question is how we can balance all of those needs in  a timely and knowledgeable manner, and what each stakeholder group is responsible for in response to  the various needs and demands, and achieving the goal of successful and safe treatments for OA, and  determining if stem cell therapeutics has a place in this category.

Yet, the  scientific evidence for effectiveness/efficacy is inconclusive and recommendations for clinical application  are variable and largely unproven. Further, there is increasing focus on issues related to stem cell safety  in this largely unregulated environment. Lastly, the challenge is also related to timeliness \u2013 the balance  between time needed to undertake the necessary research to generate sufficient understanding of what  \u2018success\u2019 looks like, and the current demands and pressing information needs of patients, clinicians and  health policy makers.    There are aso differences in approach in the sense that many clinics worldwide  provide  treatments  without  definitive  evidence,  while  some  research  groups  and  companies  are  endeavouring to complete well-designed clinical trials.  The latter take many years to complete.  ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM:  4                           BJH SCN Stem Cell White Paper \u2013 March 2017   Purpose of the Workshop:  To address these challenges, the purpose of the AHS BJH SCN Stem Cell Workshop is to engage a  range of stakeholders in an evidence-based discussion to contribute to the realization of the potential of  stem cells by generating recommendations to inform practice, research and/or policy on this emerging  therapeutic approach.  To achieve this, the theme of day 1 (Oct 27) of the workshop is where are we now, focusing on current  knowledge and perspectives of different stakeholders. Applying these learnings, the theme of Day 2 (Oct  28) is where we go from here. Engaging participants in several activities, the aim will be to identify what is  required to support access to safe and efficacious stem cell therapies for OA patients.   The first important and guiding principle of our work is how to ensure safety in a variety of environments  (e.g.  developing  effective  criteria  or  applications  in  private  offices  and  clinics,  or  privately  funded  procedures in publicly funded infrastructure, such as operating rooms) using a variety of protocols (e.g.  source of cells, isolation or enrichment parameters, number of cells to be used, etc). Secondarily, do we  need to develop vehicles such as RCTs or comparative effectiveness trials to determine the optimal  protocol(s) for stem cell use, and applications of stems \u2013 is there a greater benefit gained through their  potential immuno-modulatory / anti-inflammatory function than tissue repair? Thirdly, how do we define  success, and do we need to put in place province-wide systems to capture elements such as baseline  data, appropriate tools to capture outcomes and adverse events to monitor safety and efficacy? While the  workshop may not lead to the final answers for all of these issues, certainly the expectation is that after  the Workshop we will have a better appreciation of where we are, what is needed, and potential routes to  get to where we need to be.

Although the mechanism(s) underlying the disease are not clearly  delineated,  multiple  risk  factors  including  age,  sex,  obesity,  genetics,  and  joint  trauma  can  likely  contribute to its onset. Clinical symptoms include restricted range of motion, limited activity, neuropathic  pain, depression, and sleep disorders. Biomechanically abnormal joint loading resulting from obesity, joint  instability, or trauma can affect the bone, synovium, and muscle of the joint via progressive cartilage  deterioration, subchondral bone remodeling, loss of joint space, marginal osteophytosis (boney growths),  and loss of joint function. (Barry & Murphy 2013; Ham et al. 2015). In this context, a joint is an organ  system, where damage to one component can lead to organ failure (see Frank et al. 2004; Loeser et al.  2012).  Three  key  structures  affected  by  OA  degeneration  are  1)  articular  cartilage,  2)  menisci  and  3)  subchondral bone. Articular cartilage (AC) is a stable hyaline tissue with no blood, lymphatic, or nerve  supply. It contains only a single cell type, called chondrocytes, which remain suspended in the cartilage  matrix and are responsible for synthesizing the AC components. Chondrocytes are suspended in a highly  hydrated extracellular matrix composed of collagen fibers to provide tensile strength, proteoglycans for  compressive strength, and molecules which contribute to the \u201ctoughness\u201d of the tissue. Due to the  avascular environment and low metabolic activity of chondrocytes, AC has limited capability for intrinsic  repair (Guilak et al. 2004; Bauge & Boumediene 2015). Menisci (medial and lateral meniscus) are paired  structures composed of semilunar fibrocartilage. They play an essential role in normal function of the  knee by providing structural integrity and stability to the knee joint. Similar to AC, the natural healing  capacity of meniscal tissue is limited to the vascular region of the tissue (Yu, Adesida, & Jomha 2015;  Starke, Kopf, Petersen, & Becker 2009). Subchondral bone lies underneath the AC, providing it with  support. When subjected to microfractures the subchondral bone can act to release undifferentiated  (na\u00efve)  mesenchymal  stem cells  (MSCs)  from  the  bone  marrow  tissue  to  repair  chondral  defects.  However, this process mainly results in the formation of scar tissue or fibrocartilage. Fibrocartilage is  poorly organized and has inferior mechanical and biochemical characteristics compared to normal hyaline  cartilage. It eventually wears, leading to secondary OA. Without exposure to the subchondral bone, the  AC  has  little  access  to  undifferentiated  cells  that  promote  repair,  but  synovial  fluid  does  contain  mesenchymal stem cells which could potentially home to injured AC or menisci (de Souza et al. 2014;  Ando  et  al.  2014)  As  a  result  of  the  lack  of  observed  endogenous  repair,  acute  trauma  and/  or  degradation of the AC is most often considered irreversible.

Although effective to various  extents, currently there is no cure for advanced OA. Broadly, current therapies can be divided into non- cell-based  and  cell  based.  Non-cell  based  (exogenous)  therapies  include  interventions  such  as  microfracture and mosaicplasty. A description of this approach and additional examples of intervention  are provided in Appendix 1.   Cell based therapies have been developed as a way of therapeutically addressing the lack of effective  innate or endogenous repair systems.  These therapies aim to simulate biological restoration of lesions in  the articular surface (Bauge & Boumediene 2015). These techniques involve local delivery of ex vivo  preparations of cells with the objective of:  \u2022  Reducing degenerative changes associated with OA  \u2022  Healing AC lesions with tissue that has native AC biological and mechanical properties  \u2022  Enhancing current joint repair techniques "}, {"paragraph_number": 18, "text": " Cell  based  therapies  can  be  divided  into  differentiated  cell  therapy  (primarily  chondrocytes)  and  progenitor cell-based therapy  (primarily mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)) (Counsel, Bates, Boyd,  &  Connell 2015), which have emerged as a possible solution to both the limited source and differentiation  obstacles associated with harvesting chondrocytes (Shimomura et al. 2015). A description of the non- stem cell (or chondrocyte)-based approaches is provided in Appendix 2.  Given the focus of the workshop, the remainder of this report is specific to mesenchymal stem  cells (MSC).   Stem Cell Based Therapies broadly encompass any treatment of a disease or condition that utilizes the  stem cell\u2019s ability to proliferate and differentiate. Stem cells are defined as undifferentiated or non- specialized cells that can replicate and differentiate into more than one type of cell with specialized  functions (Barry & Murphy; Uzbas et al. 2015; Martin, De Boer, & Sensebe 2016).    Research utilizing stem cells for cartilage repair have focused on utilizing mesenchymal stem cells  (MSCs), also labelled as bone marrow stromal cells, multipotential adult stem cells, human marrow  stromal cells, or mesenchymal progenitors (Guilak et al. 2004). These adult stem cells are widely thought  to have their origins in the mesoderm, however, recent studies have posited origins from the neural crest  ectoderm. They are distinguished by their potential to differentiate into cartilage, bone, muscle, tendon,  ligament, and fat (Pittenger et al. 1999). MSCs have the capacity for self-renewal and rapid proliferation,  and  are  particularly  attractive  for  treatments  aimed  at  OA  due  to  paracrine  anti-inflammatory  and  immunomodulatory  properties.  Current  therapies  primarily  utilize  adult  stem  cells,  given  the  ethical  concerns related to harvesting of embryonic stem cells (Counsel 2015).

Further, evidence indicates MSCs isolated from progressive  OA joints are substantially limited in proliferation and differentiation potential (Barry & Murphy  2103) and have other altered features (Krawetz et al 2012; Harris et al 2013), pointing to a role  \u2018healthy\u2019 MSCs could have in preventing joint degradation. (Barry & Murphy 2013). It is important  to note, the differentiation deficiencies of OA MSCs can be reversed by culturing on mediums  supplemented with epidermal growth factor; therefore use of autologous MSCs is still a viable  option (Barry & Murphy 2013).

For cartilage repair techniques, the most common sources include  adipose tissue (subcutaneous and infrapatellar fat pad), autologous bone marrow, and synovial fluid; less  commonly used were peripheral blood and periosteum sources (Counsel 2015). Preclinical trials have  exploited a wider variety of tissues including skeletal muscle, amniotic fluid, synovial membrane, and  dental pulp (Counsel et al. 2015; Xu-et al. 2015; discussed in Hart 2014). Other natural sources include  umbilical cord blood, endometrium, and placenta (Counsel et al. 2015).   8                           BJH SCN Stem Cell White Paper \u2013 March 2017   Although there are common characteristics between the cells from each source, significant differences  exist. These include: expression of cell surface markers, immunomodulatory activity, abundance and  ease of harvest, proliferation and differentiation potential, as well as potential tissue-specific epigenetic  alterations that can influence cell activities (Xu et al. 2015, Perez-Camp et al 2015; discussed in Hart  2014).  Cell  populations  from  different  sources  seem  to  be  \u2018inclined\u2019  towards  certain  lineages.  For  example, cells derived from bone marrow appear to undergo osteogenesis effectively, while those from  synovial fluid or synovial membranes tend to undergo chondrogenesis (Ando et al. 2014; discussed in  Hart 2014). These differences influence the sources potential utility in stem cell therapy. Disadvantages  and advantages associated with the most common cartilage repair sources are outlined in Appendix 3.  Preparation of MSCs   Once tissue has been harvested, there are two main methods of preparing cells before their application  as a stem cell therapy (see Martin et al. 2016 for more discussion).  Concentrated - The aspirate (or extract) of fluid, connective tissue, and cells is separated into the  mononuclear cells (the aspirate) and the extraneous tissues (Chahla et al. 2016). This can be done via  collagenase digestion (for adipose derived cells) or centrifuging (bone marrow derived cells) (Filardo et al.  2016). Depending on the tissue source, the resulting aspirate concentrate can have, in addition to MSCs,  a variety of growth factors, immune cells, leukocytes, and others (Counsel et al. 2015; Filardo et al.  2016). In concentrates, the cells are \u201cfree\u201d or modified but not extensively manipulated.  Use of concentrated aspirates, such as stromal vascular fraction (SVF) and bone marrow concentrate  (BMC) have advantages of negligible time lag between extraction and implantation, as there are devices  that can distill (or concentrate) aspirate down to a reasonable volume to ensure same-day harvesting and  implantation procedures (Counsel et al. 2015). This minimizes risks of contamination during cell culture,  and reduces cost and logistical challenges of treatment (Counsel et al. 2015). The non-MSC components  of the concentrate have also been speculated to have anabolic and anti-inflammatory effects, which could  further promote positive outcomes (Chahla et al. 2016). Further, this technique is also not considered a  pharmacological intervention in most jurisdictions, and therefore does not currently require regulatory  approval.   The disadvantages of such concentrated preparations lie in the variability of the number of MSCs in the  preparations, as well as the environment of the concentrate (Filardo et al. 2013; Wolfstadt et al. 2015).  MSC counts vary widely between patients, therefore standardization of concentrate injections is currently  limited (Counsel et al. 2015). The number of cells used for treatment is also limited to what can be  extracted  (Feisst,  Meidinger,  &  Locke  2015).  In  addition,  there  is  concern  the  autologous  microenvironment  of  the  concentrate  can  be  influenced  by  local  pro-  and  anti-inflammatory  small  molecules, decreasing the healing potential of the extracted MSC (Ham et al. 2015; Woldstadt et al.  2015). This would be particularly problematic in patients with risk factors for decreased number and  quality of MSCs (ex: obesity, elevated age, OA), as they may not benefit from significant clinical outcomes  (Wolfstadt et al. 2015).   9                           BJH SCN Stem Cell White Paper \u2013 March 2017   Expanded - Expansion is an amplification process that allows for the isolation of a homologous sample of  MSC, and as well as obtaining the cell numbers thought necessary for therapeutic advantages (Counsel  et al. 2015; Feisst et al. 2015). Expansion occurs in a culture medium with or without exogenous serum or  non-serum supplements.   Once expanded, MSCs can usually be injected directly, or undergo activation toward chondrogenesis to  further increase the healing potential (Bauge & Boumediene 2015; Filardo et al. 2013). Activation has  been achieved by the addition of growth factors or cytokines, and culturing in hypoxic conditions (Bauge  & Boumediene 2015; Filardo et al. 2013; Adesida et al. 2012). Addition of a variety of cytokines has been  shown to overcome the low chondrogenic potential of adipose derived stem cells (ADSC) in some studies  (Filardo et al. 2013; Ham 2015).    Expanding, or culturing, of the concentrated aspirate is advantageous because MSCs are rare under  normal conditions and the aspirate mixture includes non-MSC cell populations (Wong et al. 2013).   Techniques for Delivery of MSCs  There are a number of techniques used to deliver prepared MSCs to the affected area, however, they can  be broadly categorized into injection (non-surgical procedure) and implantation (surgical procedure).  (Filardo et al. 2013) \u2013 see Figure 2.  Injection  -  This  may  involve  injection  of  stem  cells  directly  into  the  intra-articular  synovial  fluid  compartment, either immediately after extraction (concentrated form) or after expansion/amplification (2-4  weeks post extraction). The medium is usually hyaluronic acid, a major component of synovial fluid, and a  molecule already in use via injections for treatment of OA (Barry & Murphy 2013) or co-supplementation  using commercial preparations. Injections can be direct delivery of MSCs in hyaluronic acid, or in an  attempt to improve the therapeutic impact of the transplanted MSCs, be mixed with growth factors and  cytokines, most commonly platelet-rich plasma (PRP) (Ham 2015). PRP is an enriched autologous  sources of chondrogenic growth factors including TGF-\u03b2 and platelet-derived growth factor (Ham 2015).  Intra-articular injections have the advantages of easy application, limited surgical time, short recovery  time, low cost, and low risk to the patient (Filardo et al. 2013; Kristjansson & Honsawek 2014). However,  a key finding remains that only a small percentage of the MSC populations injected into the joint actually  remain at the site of injury (discussed in Hart 2014). The imprecise site delivery and poor localization of  MSC (discussed in Hart 2014; Filardo et al. 2013; Hart 2014) have led to the innovation of implantation  techniques.

Implantation procedures can be done in a one or two step  approach. In one step procedures, the harvested cells are mechanically dissociated, and embedded in a  scaffold,  and  implanted  in  one  surgical  stage  (Filardo  et  al.  2013).  Two  step  procedures  involve  harvesting  cells  and  then  ex  vivo  expansion  and  possibly  amplification  (Filardo  et  al.  2013).  The  processed cells are then seeded into a scaffold matrix and implanted in a second surgical procedure  (Filardo et al. 2013).   Implantation of MSC can be carried with or without a scaffold (Barry & Murphy 2013). Scaffolds were  innovated in order to provide a 3-D structure for easy handling of the cell culture and to prevent  chondrocyte leakage from the implantation site (Filardo et al. 2013). A scaffold is a structure made of a  biocompatible biologic or synthetic material (Barry & Murphy 2013). It is used as a mechanism to aid stem  cell adhesion, differentiation, proliferation, as well as provide a provisional three-dimensional matrix to  promote tissue formation (Bornes, Adesida, & Jomha 2014; Bauge & Boumediene 2015). They are a   11                           BJH SCN Stem Cell White Paper \u2013 March 2017   challenging engineering feat as they should be biodegradable, permeable, reproducible, non-cytotoxic,  and temporary (Bentley et al. 2013). The first matrices introduced into clinical practice were hyaluronic  acid or collagen based (Filardo et al. 2013). These ingredients are already components of hyaline  cartilage, and therefore are potentially able to integrate readily (Filardo et al. 2013). Additional information  regarding scaffolds is provided in Appendix 4.  Current research with hydrogels, polymers, biomimetic  scaffolds and nanomaterials provide exciting new possibilities for optimising the cell construct and the  repair response.  Implantation can be achieved scaffold-free using a \u2018one step repair technique\u2019 by direct injection of  suspended free MSCs, or by mixing the cells with cytokines or growth factors, such as a platelet gel,  platelet-rich fibrin glue, collagen powder, or hyaluronic acid gel sponges. The implantation is then secured  by a periosteal or collagen cover (Counsel et al.  2015). However, these scaffold-free approaches have  been met with challenges. Due to its unique matrix organization, AC has anti-adhesive properties that  present challenges for integration of implanted tissues. In addition, animal studies have shown the suture  track used to secure the patch to the surrounding cartilage can triggered subsequent degradation of the  margin between implant and adjacent AC (Shimomura et al. 2015). Further, the implanted cells do not  contain an extra-cellular matrix to assemble the implanted cells in the same highly organized manner as  in the native cartilage (Shimomura et al. 2015). To address these issues,  some researchers have  developed scaffold-free 3D Tissue Engineered Constructs (TEC). These are monolayer cultures of MSCs  exposed to a medium that increases collagen synthesis to create a sheet-like structure. This matrix  contracts to form TEC derived from MSCs. With or without chondrogenic stimulation, the organized TEC  can be implanted into a defect without a covering, and with higher integration potential (Shimomura et al.  2015).   Point of interest  Scaffolds without cells (or cell free scaffolds)  A new technique gaining interest involves triggering \u2018in situ\u2019 cartilage repair by implantation of various  biomaterials without cells that subsequent promote stem cell chondrogenesis (Filardo et al. 2013). This  approach is based on the function of scaffolds as not just carriers of cells, but also that they possess the  ability to stimulate chondral or osteochondral regeneration (Kon et al. 2015). An example of this is  autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC), combines microfracture with the implantation of a  collagen bilayer matrix to stabilize the resulting blood clot. AMIC \u201cplus\u201d procedures add a platelet-rich  plasma (PRP) gel to further enhance the healing response (Filardo et al. 2013).

For example, currently there are 17 open clinical trials underway around the world specifically  focused stem cell therapy for osteoarthritis (Appendix 5).   We conducted  a  systematic  search  of  the  published  literature  to  generate  a  knowledge  synthesis  regarding the efficacy and safety of MSC-based treatments for OA. The search was focused on reviews  (systematic reviews, comprehensive reviews, clinical reviews, and/or meta-analysis) published between  2006 and 2016 (Sept to May) in the English language which discussed clinical studies on humans for the  treatment of cartilage lesions (chondral and/or osteochondral defects and/or lesions) with mesenchymal  stem cells (MSCs). The methods used in the generating the knowledge synthesis are described in further  detail in Appendix 6 and Appendix 7.  Our search resulted in the identification of 19 reviews that met our inclusion criteria (listed in Appendix  8). The reviews were published between 2013 and 2016. Ten of the reviews were systematic reviews.  Two reviews included a meta-analysis. The reviews were authored by international group of scientists  13                           BJH SCN Stem Cell White Paper \u2013 March 2017   from  Europe,  Asia,  and  North  America.  More  than  half  were  published  from  European  research  institutions (11/19), predominantly from Italy. Two were published by Canadian research teams, one of  which is co-authored by scientists based at the University of Alberta (Adetola Adesida and Nadr Jomha).   There were a total of 261 studies cited in the reviews, 67 of which were cited multiple times (see  Appendix 9). The types of clinical studies included in the reviews were case reports, case series,  comparative trials (e.g. case control, cohort studies, controlled studies), and RCTs (see Appendix 10). It  is important to note that more than half of the clinical studies (11/19) included in these reviews are  considered low level evidence (level IV and V): case reports and case series. RCTs, considered the \u201cgold  standard\u201d in determining efficacy, represented only 10% of the body of knowledge which currently informs  currently conclusions regarding efficacy/ effectiveness and safety.   The MSC source was reported in all but one review. The most common sources of the MSC were bone  marrow (bone marrow concentrate and bone marrow aspirate concentrate) and adipose tissue, cited in  11/19 and 10/19 reviews, respectively. Stromal vascular fraction (SVF), which is derived from adipose  tissue, was specifically addressed in three of the nineteen reviews. Less common MSC sources include:  peripheral blood (5/19), synovial fluid (2/19), umbilical cord (2/19), and amniotic fluid (1/19).  A number of different approaches for preparing MSC were described.  This included use of non- modified (or non-expanded) MSCs (7/19); expanded MSC (where expansion took place from 3-4 hours to  3 to 5 weeks) (9/19); expanded and cultured (6/19); expanded and centrifuged (1/19); centrifuged only  (1/19); and expanded, cultured, stimulated and minimally processed with centrifuge (1/19).   As described earlier, the MSC delivery mechanisms currently used in research and in clinical settings  are broadly categorized as injection and implantation through surgical procedures.  Twelve reviews  included studies using injections. The most common sources of MSC used in injections are bone marrow  aspirate concentrate (BMAC), adipose tissue and peripheral blood. Several reviews also include studies  where BMAC injections were combined with hyaluronic acid or various serums. Implantation was used in  studies cited in twelve reviews; application of a variety of scaffolds was discussed in all twelve of these  reviews. It is worth noting that for one step scaffold approaches, bone marrow concentrate has been the  main  choice,  whereas  expanded  MSCs  are  preferred  for  two-step  approaches  (Kon  et  al.  2015).   Implantation of MSC-seeded matrices, which are also available in a range of biomaterials such as  collagen, fibrin glue and platelet rich fibrin glue, were described in six  reviews . Four reviews included  studies that used the scaffold-free implantation method.  Most study designs included a co-intervention(s) \u2013 interventions used in conjunction with the specific  stem  cell  approach.  There  are  numerous  co-interventions  being  used.  The  most  common  are  microfracture,  sub-chondral  drilling,  debridement,  and  platelet  rich  plasma  (PRP).  Those  cited  less  commonly include hyaluronic acid, albumin and serum, osteophyte removal, and surgical interventions  such as ACL repair and high tibial osteotomy (HTO).  14                           BJH SCN Stem Cell White Paper \u2013 March 2017   Effectiveness of the interventions was determined through observation and measurement of structural  outcomes of tissue repair and clinical outcomes based on function and symptom relief. Measurement  tools used to evaluate structural outcomes are provided in Table 1. Specific features of tissue repair  that were assessed were implant stability, defect filling, integration with border zones, cartilage thickness,  regeneration  of  cartilage  or  that  hyaline-like  features  were  exhibited  (rather  than  the  presence  of  fibrocartilage).  Consistently  measured  clinical  outcomes  were:  pain,  quality  of  life,  and  physical  functioning (which includes, walking, activities of daily living, sport activities). These were measured using  a broad range of outcome measures, listed in Table 1, with additional descriptive information provided in  Appendix 11. Other outcomes of interest were joint function, range of motion, and safety. The review by  Peeters et al. (2013) focused specifically on safety, where \u201cSevere Adverse Events (SAE)\u201d were defined  as  death,  neoplasms,  infections,  pulmonary  embolisms,  anaphylactic  shock  and  haematological  neoplasms.

Efficacy  With a broad brush stroke, clinical trials and expertise suggests that stem cell therapies are effective in  symptomatic  relief  related  to  chondral  defects  and  defects,  or  lesions  resulting  from  degenerative  processes leading to osteoarthritis. There is variability in terms of what was observed and/or measured as  a significant improvement and variability in the methods of comparison to traditional or standard care  procedures (e.g. microfracture) (Chahla et al. 2016; Gopal et al. 2014; Kon et al 2014).

The potential of stem cell efficacy is evident. However, the consensus of the scientific community at this  time is that although promising, the findings are preliminary and inconclusive.

Peeters et al. (2013), authors of a systematic review focused on stem cell safety, conclude:  \u201c\u2026based on current literature review, we conclude that application of cultured stem cells in joints appears  to be safe\u201d. Perceived safety is also based on the fact that comparatively, more recent approaches and  techniques for MSC application are less invasive than traditional or standard care approaches. For  example,  they  do  not  involve  the  donor  site  morbidity  requirements  of  autologous  chondrocyte  implantation (ACI), which may lead to additional risks related to the donor site. However, areas flagged as  requiring consideration (specific attention) to ensure safety  include  procedure-related complications,  device-related complications, and re-operation rate (Fischer & Kisser 2016).   There appears to be a general consensus that stem cell therapies are safe, however, several authors of  the reviews state that adverse event reporting and safety specific outcomes in published work is either  under-reported or poorly reported (inconsistent or incomplete).

Controlling risk while using MSCs demands regulation of their  isolation and manipulation, the process of application, and mitigation of any long term side effects. All of  these require evidence and quality assurance, particularly GMP manufacturing facilities. Certainly, most  of the literature would suggest safety in the short term, except for a small number of deaths reported in  the USA that are currently being investigated. The long term safety has yet to be fully determined.   Another key linking issue is regarding balancing the needs and demands of the stakeholders in a timely  manner to ensure safety.  Some of these disconnect between current needs and the prolonged timeline  for validation of MSC applications has led to the development of a \u201ccottage industry\u201d regarding the use of  MSC injections for patients who pay out of pocket for the procedures. The growth of this cottage industry  in a mainly unregulated manner, is now appearing on government radars to ensure patients are not at  risk. To move ahead, we have to balance risk with needs, but certainly mitigating risk is critical.  The second big issue is that of MSC application effectiveness. The term effectiveness is complex, as it  depends on the definition of success in their use from the patient perspective (e.g. independent living,  quality of life, decreased disability, less pain, etc), the clinical perspective (e.g. structural repair of  17                           BJH SCN Stem Cell White Paper \u2013 March 2017   damaged cartilage, mensci, etc in addition to symptom management), and the government perspective  (e.g. decreased use of the health care system, a return to employment, etc)  Moving forward will require perseverance, as well as stewardship in the research community, combined  with efficient exchange of valid information based on rigorous science and clinical experience.

"}, {"paragraph_number": 44, "text": " CONCLUSIONS:  Current studies appear to confirm the potential of MSC use in joint injury repair and in OA specifically.  Thus, the hope remains, that is the reality. However, limitation or progress in the field depends, in large  part, on standardization of protocols for use of MSC and long term outcomes assessment in a largely  unregulated industry. This is complicated by the fact that most patients pay out of pocket for these private  services in Alberta and other domains. Thus, there is likely a need for certification of facilities, validation  of protocols, and formation of long term databases to ensure patient safety and procedure effectiveness.  In addition, continued work in advancing our knowledge in this area is need which is dependent on active  participation of funding bodies, including government agencies, to investment in large clinical trials and  the  establishment  and  commissioning  of  centralized  GMP  facilities  in  Alberta  (or  nationally).   The  realization of the potential of stem cells as a viable therapeutic option is based on a determination of who  is  responsible  for  safety  (e.g.  Government,  regulatory  bodies)  and  effectiveness  (e.g.  researchers,  clinicians, policy makers). Therefore progress forward is a shared responsibility, central to which are the  patients seeking and undertaking this form of treatment.

The issue of stem cells and their application for the treatment of osteoarthritis is complex. This complexity  results from the biology of the stem cell itself (heterogeneity, incomplete characterization, differences in  function between in vitro and in-vivo), the numerous options currently experimented with regard to the  different sources that can be used, and then, how the stem cells are extracted or harvested, processed or  prepared, and delivered to the patient. The complexity is then further driven by the need for decision  making \u2013 at the patient, clinical practice and the policy levels \u2013 in an environment where patients are  actively seeking such a treatment even given the limitations of our current knowledge regarding efficacy.  Thus, there is need for better communication with patients and providers who council patients to consider  stem cell therapy, more research evidence to define the cells and their efficacy, standardization of  protocols used, generation of databases to monitor safety and efficacy, and optimizing patient outcomes.  The hope of stem cell use to treat osteoarthritis, currently a non-curable disease, is an emerging area of  research and clinical application with intensive focus from around the world on generating solid evidence  and knowledge about stem cells and their function in treating and/or repairing damage joint tissues. The  blunt reality is that currently (late 2016), we simply do not know conclusively if stem cells are an effective  OA treatment. And, if the observed effects reported to date are as a result of the stem cell itself (and its  characteristics), placebo effects, and/or related factors or co-factors. In fact, there is a greatly deal of  uncertainty if it is the stem cells at all that are the mechanism driving any observable effect.  Closely associated with the issue of efficacy is safety. Although research and clinical experience suggests  that autologous stem cell applications are safe, it remains a concern. Thus, questions of safety continue  to arise with respect to the use of autologous or allogenic stem cells, and their various sources (e.g. bone  marrow, adipose tissue etc).  Such questions are also impacted by the various procedures used in the  extraction, processing/preparation, and delivery of the stem cells as in more instances it is not known  whether there is 1 or a million stem cells being re-administered to the patient. Furthermore, the quality of  the environments where stem cells are prepared and delivered requires attention. Although facilities, such  as those currently run by Calgary Lab Services and the GMP facility associated with the University of  Alberta, follow international standards, other clinical settings are a potential concern due to the relatively  unregulated nature of such facilities.  The above issues were presented and discussed by workshop participants in order to identify how we  may proceed in Alberta given the emergent and complex nature of this treatment approach. We elaborate  on these issues on the following pages: "}, {"paragraph_number": 46, "text": " 21                           BJH SCN Stem Cell White Paper \u2013 March 2017 "}, {"paragraph_number": 47, "text": " 1.  Access to stem cell treatments  Currently stem cell treatments for OA are not publicly funded. As such, patients who choose this  treatment option pay for it privately. These raised the question of whether it should be offered through the  public system and if so, what are the implications, including funding. Other key questions that require  further consideration in determining access include: first, who is mostly likely to benefit from stem cell  treatments and when should stem cell treatment be considered as a treatment option. This is related to  stage of the disease, co-morbidities (e.g. obesity, diabetes) which impact the stem cell function, age etc.  Secondly, who (what providers) should be delivering stem cells.   The above is of course depends on the core question of whether or not stem cells should be made  available as a treatment option in Alberta today, given the current health care environment and state of  knowledge on efficacy. The position of the workshop participants (representing multi-stakeholders) was  not clear and nor did they settle on one conclusive option. There was a distinct opinion that we should not  be offering stem cells as a treatment option at this time, in private or public settings, as we simply do not  know enough about stem cells and their potential efficacy. This was balanced by the opinion that given  that they are generally perceived to be safe and patients are seeking out this treatment, and will travel  outside of Alberta to receive it, we should make it available in the private settings, but with a focus on  standardization to ensure safety, and data collection to monitor both safety and efficacy (which is limited  in interpretation due to the unblinded nature of the treatment). Thus, if made available in certified facilities,  it should be monitored for an extended period of time with standardized outcomes.   Although consensus was not sought through the workshop, it was evident that there was mixed opinions  expressed by the stakeholders present regarding current access to stem cell treatment for OA in Alberta.   2.  Standardization   If stem cells are to be delivered in Alberta, now or in the future, a key issue that arose was how to  standardize the processes to ensure safe (and effective) delivery. Standardization refers to how to define  procedures to ensure consistency and alignment with evidence and or best practice. Discussions pointed  to the fact that standardization needs to occur at several levels or points: the facilitates where  stem cells  are prepared (extraction, processing and delivery mechanisms), the provider delivering the treatment, and  the site where the processing and/or treatment is being provided.  Development of such standardizations  should involve regulatory bodies (e.g. the College of Physicians and Surgeons), federal bodies (Health  Canada), and a multi-stakeholder working group to contribute to such guideline development.  3.  Generating evidence of efficacy   Our knowledge in this area is advancing, however, the evidence regarding mechanism of action and  efficacy is currently inconclusive. As such, ongoing research is needed. Specifically, it was recognized  22                           BJH SCN Stem Cell White Paper \u2013 March 2017   that Phase 3 and 4 randomized trials are required. Alberta may be a potential site for a trial, informed by  an international advisory panel; however, given the work already underway and the relations that were  initiated through the workshop, there was also consideration of Alberta making a meaningful contribution  to the work of experts in the field and/or well established programs. Another approach which was  discussed, and mentioned above, was the development of a provincial database to capture standardized  outcomes within clinics delivering this treatment in Alberta as a first step. Thus, one responsibility of being  certified, could be the requirement to participate in such databases.   4.  Communication tools to support decision making  There is a clear need for credible and comprehensive information on this emerging treatment for OA that  will inform decision making. The appetite for such communication tools was quite strong, but the audience  for such communications is diverse. The key stakeholders identified through the workshop include:  patients, front line Health Professionals (Family Physicians, Physiotherapists, etc), providers (delivering  stem cells or addressing questions from patients about stem cells), policy makers, and regulators. The  communication vehicles and access points may vary from one stakeholder group to the next, however, it  was recommended that all need to inform the recipient regarding the current state of knowledge, the  complexity associated with this treatment approach, and potential risks. Thus, appropriate communication  tools, frequently updated, would assist in managing expectations of patients, and be a trusted source of  information for health care professionals.  5.  Collaborative relationships   Given that the issue of stem cells as a potential health care intervention for OA impacts and is influenced  by various stakeholders, there was recognition that forging relationships to enable safe and effective  delivery of stem cells is critical. Such relationships may involve the private and public health care sectors  in the province; clinical practices and academia to ensure appropriate interpretation of results and their  implications; as well as researchers to allow for efficient use of research resources required to perform  the required research and trials. Given that stem cells as a potential treatment for OA are not isolated to  Alberta, we may also consider partnerships with national and international stakeholders external to  Alberta who are already doing work in this area. The bottom line is that partnerships, both locally and  internationally, are beneficial to enable appropriateness and efficiency of efforts put forward, to enhance  the rate of progress, and to avoid redundancy in efforts.  "}, {"paragraph_number": 48, "text": " Action items  The BJH SCN led the initiation of this multi-stakeholder discussion on stem cell treatment for OA in  Alberta. It now has an instrumental role in facilitating action around these three topics. It is imperative that  we maintain the momentum generated at the workshop and ensure that there is productive and proactive  action on these key issues. Therefore, we recognize it is our responsible for enabling the movement  23                           BJH SCN Stem Cell White Paper \u2013 March 2017   forward. Given our provincial leadership role, we are well positioned to enable and facilitate cross- provincial collaborations of the necessary stakeholders to move forward.   Based on the rich discussion and emergent ideas and recommendations, several areas requiring  attention to ensure we proactively move forward in Alberta on the issue of stem cells for OA were  identified. One of the key outputs of the workshop is the identification of three priority areas that need  immediate action:  1.  Establish the efficacy of stem cells for the treatment of osteoarthritis.   2.  Develop appropriate communication tools and strategies to ensure that the right information is  accessible to inform decision making by patients, providers and policy makers  3.  Standardization of practice for safe delivery of stem cells for OA  These priority areas will be addressed by implementation committees. Each will be tasked with identifying  specific recommendations and engaging in the required activities to progress the work in that area.

These mechanisms are thought to trigger the innate biological repair systems and can lead to   influx of chondroprogenitor cells (Counsel). However, these approaches tend to result in the formation of  fibrocartilaginous repair tissue. While this can decrease pain and morbidity with proper rehabilitation in  the short and intermediate term, it does not appear to lead to  the differentiation  of cells into the  chondrocyte lineage, and therefore, has little efficacy as a long term solution (Guilak 2004). Other  mechanical approaches have involved osteochondral grafting (mosaicplasty) and high tibial osteotomy  (HTO). (Guilak 2004 & Bauge & Wong 2013). Osteochondral grafts involve transplantation from a tissue  donor  (allografts),  or  from  the  patient\u2019s  own  body  (autografts)  of  healthy  cartilage  and  underlying  subchondral  bone  are  also  options  that  have  been  used  clinically.  However,  they  have  met  with  challenges of integration of the implanted graft and host cartilage, limited availability of non-weight- bearing grafts, as well as evidence for long-term efficacy (Guilak 2004, Hangody 2003). High tibial  osteotomy (HTO) involves shortening of the tibia, and effectively leads to an unload of the medial  compartment to allow some easing of stresses on articular cartilage (Wong 2013). This approach has  shown to be an effective clinical intervention, however, is not a long term solution (Wong 2013).   The main limitation: These therapies do not replace cartilage lesions with tissue that replicates the  biological, biomechanical, and physical structure of native AC (Filardo 2013). Further, the long term  efficacy of non-cell based therapies continues to be unproven (Guilak- 2004).

This takes the form of  autologous  chondrocyte  implantations  (ACI)  using  mature  chondrocytes  (Counsel,  2015).  Mature  chondrocytes can be quiescent within the AC matrix, analogous to osteocytes in bone. During limb  development, chondrocytes form the cartilage in the joint space (Goldring 2012) or undergo chondrocyte  hypertrophy, ultimately being calcified and reabsorbed by bone. (Goldring 2012). Chondrocytes used in  autologous  chondrocyte  implantations  are  sourced  from  healthy  cartilage  at  non-weight  bearing,  unaffected parts of the joint (Filardo 2013). Target areas for extraction include the non-weight bearing  area of the intercondylar notch or the femoral condyle superior ridge). (Bauge 2015) The cartilage can be  obtained  from  the  patient  themselves  (autograft)  or  from  a  donor  (allograft),  although  autologous  chondrocytes are preferred due to decreased risk of immunogenic response or disease transfer (Bauge  2015). autologous chondrocyte implantation therapies utilize mature, cultured autologous chondrocytes  suspend in an injection suspension and covered with periosteal flap (ACI-P) as in first generation ACI, or  collagen membrane (ACI-C) as in second generation ACI. In third generation techniques, chondrocytes  are seeded into a collagen membrane (matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation, MACI) and  implanted into cartilage lesions. (Counsel 2015). Since introduction of MACI into clinical practice in 1998  (Filardo 2013), a wide variety of study populations, technical procedure, surgical approach, and matrix  compositions have been seen in the research literature. (Filardo 2013). The potential for ACI is limited by  the availability of healthy cartilage donor sites. (Bauge 2015). There have also been challenges in cell  culturing: monolayer chondrocyte cultures often switch to production of fibrocartilage collagen (collagen I)  than the preferred hyaline cartilage collagen (collagen II) (Bauge 2015). Scaffolding techniques can limit  the number of cells that can be transplanted successfully (Bulman 2013). Further, there are links to poor  outcomes due to obesity, smoking history, and age. (Bentley 2013). There is a paucity of literature  comparing stem cell treatment to ACI (Counsel 2013).    The main limitations: Limited donor tissue availability for transplantation, morbidity at the donor site;   differentiation leading to hypertrophy of implanted chondrocytes, and de-differentiation during the  expansion phase leading to the formation of fibrocartilage (Jayasuriya 2015).

In recent years, there has been the development  of  a  variety  of  biomaterial  matrices  that  vary  by  fixation  technique,  treatment  in  bioreactors,  and  composition of scaffold (Filardo 2013). A number of natural materials have emerged for scaffolds such as  agarose, alginate, fibrin glue and chitosan (Filardo 2013). Synthetic scaffolds are commonly made up of  polylactides,  including  polylactic  and  polyglycolic  acid  (Filardo  2013).  The  opportunity  to  innovate  regarding the composition and physical forms (ex: fibers, meshes, gels) of these scaffolds has led to a  number of patented products including Haylograft C, Bioseed c, and NeoCart to name a few (Filardo  2013). While 3-D scaffolds for ACI (autologous chondrocyte implantation) have been in used for some  time (as early as 2001), scaffolds seeded with MSCs have had less rigorous analysis (Bauge 2015), but  this is an active area of research. In the treatment of osteochondral articular defects, specific biphasic  scaffolds have been developed to meet the challenge of guiding the growth of the bone and articular  cartilage involved in the defect (Filardo 2013). Biphasic scaffolds are in their clinical infancy, however,  they are somewhat revolutionary in their attempt to treat the entire osteochondral unit as an integrated  composite.

As our goal  was to identify the current state of knowledge, the search was focused on published reviews (systematic  reviews, comprehensive reviews, clinical reviews, and/or meta-analysis) published between 2006 and  2016 (Sept. and May) in the English language which discussed clinical studies on humans for the  treatment of cartilage lesions (chondral and/or osteochondral defects and/or lesions) with cell based  therapies, specifically mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).  Reviews matching our criteria were identified through a systematic search of 6 databases: Embase,  Medline, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through OVID), as well as CINHAL, Web of  Science, and Sport Discus. The search was conducted between May and August 2016 and supported by  a University of Calgary Health Sciences librarian and the AHS Knowledge Team librarian. Keywords and  subject headings [MeSH] used for each database are provided in the table below. In addition, reference  lists of included articles were reviewed to identify any articles that may have been missed. Articles  recommended by members of the workshop planning committee were also gathered and screened for  inclusion.   Data extracted from each review included: geographic location of authorship team, year of publication,  type of review, level(s) of evidence of sited studies, source of MSC, preparation methods, delivery  techniques,  co-interventions,  outcome  measurement  tools,  outcomes  reported,  and  safety  issues  identified. Relevant data were extracted and collected in a unique database with the consensus of all co- authors.   In total 695 studies were identified from all sources based on the search terms. An additional 9 resources  were found through independent searches and recommendations. In the abstract and title screening, 625  studies in total were excluded: 17 duplicates, 605 were not review articles, and 3 were excluded when the  full text could not be accessed. 70 studies remained, and another their titles and abstracts were screened  in detail. 50 articles were excluded: 1  was a conference poster presentation, 4 had exclusively  a  preclinical focus, 3 were not review articles, 6 did not focus on cell therapies, and 28 did not complete a  comprehensive review of the literature. 28 full text articles were left. Upon further scrutiny, 8 were deemed  to have not evaluated the current clinical studies on the topic. 20 full text records were included in the  final analysis.
